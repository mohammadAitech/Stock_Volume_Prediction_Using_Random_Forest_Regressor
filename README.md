# Stock Volume Prediction with Random Forest  

This project demonstrates the use of a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict stock volume based on historical stock data. It includes data preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.  

## Features  
- **Date Handling**: Converts date columns to numerical format for compatibility with machine learning models.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Implements a regression model with adjustable depth and leaf parameters.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses MSE to measure model accuracy.  

## Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  

You can install the required packages using:  
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
